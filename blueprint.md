# Blueprint: New Product Page Design

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to create a new product page with a modern design, inspired by the user's provided images. The page will include a functional shopping cart overlay.

## Current Plan
1.  **Add Category Filter Buttons:**
    *   Create a container for the filter buttons in `products.html` above the product grid.
    *   Dynamically generate the filter buttons from the product categories in `productos.js`.
    *   Implement the filtering logic in `productos.js` to show/hide products based on the selected category.
    *   Style the filter buttons and their active state in `productos.css`.

2.  **Fix Cart Functionality:**
    *   Modify `cart.js` to automatically open the cart overlay when a product is added.
    *   Ensure items are correctly rendered in the cart.

3.  **Redesign Hero Section:**
    *   Update `products.html` with a new two-column layout for the hero section, based on the Starbucks image.
    *   The left column will contain the title, description, price, and a new "Buy Now" button.
    *   The right column will feature a product image with a circular background and a list of features.

4.  **Update CSS (`productos.css`):**
    *   Completely redesign the hero section styles to match the new layout.
    *   Style the new "Buy Now" button and the feature list.
    *   Ensure all new styles are responsive.

5.  **Verify Overall Functionality:**
    *   Test the redesigned page to ensure the hero section looks correct and the cart is fully functional.
